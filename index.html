        <article class="content">
            <p>Thank you for using TasX ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
            <p>TasX functions as a client for the Google Tasks™ API. To provide its features, the App requires access to specific information from your Google Account after you grant permission through the Google Sign-In process.</p>
            <p>We do **not** store your personal data on our own servers. All data is either read directly from Google's servers to your device or stored locally and securely in a private database on your device.</p>
            <p>The information we access includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> We use your basic Google profile information (such as your name and email address) solely to display it within the app for a personalized experience (e.g., "Welcome, [Your Name]").</li>
                <li><strong>Google Tasks Data:</strong> The App requests permission to access your Google Tasks data. This includes reading your task lists and the tasks within them (including titles, notes/descriptions, and due dates). It also includes the ability to create, edit, complete, or delete task lists and tasks on your behalf, as directed by your actions within the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used exclusively to provide the functionality of the App on your device.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Google Account information is used to authenticate you.</li>
                <li>Your Google Tasks data is used to display, group, sort, and modify your tasks and task lists as you direct.</li>
                <li>All operations (creating, editing, deleting) are performed directly against the Google Tasks API and are reflected in your Google Tasks account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> All of your task data remains stored on Google's servers within your own Google Tasks account. We do not have our own servers, and we do not make a separate copy of your data on any external server.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage (Cache):</strong> To provide a faster experience and offline access, the App stores a local copy (a cache) of your tasks data in a secure, private database on your device. This data is not accessible by other apps and is only used to display your tasks when you are offline or to make the app load faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise share your personal information or your tasks data with any third parties.</p>

            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p>
